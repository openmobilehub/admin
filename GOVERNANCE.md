## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for overseeing all technical aspects of the project, Open Mobile Hub (OMH), and its subsidiary projects under the Linux Foundation organization.

The initial TSC voting members are referenced from the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file within the Project’s code repositories as voting members of the TSC. Election or removal of TSC voting members requires a majority vote of the current TSC members. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

Decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. In cases where a majority is not reached, the matter may be deferred to the next meeting or decided through an electronic vote.

In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TSC, any voting member of the TSC may refer the matter to LF for assistance in reaching a resolution.

The TSC Chair will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. The TSC voting members are:

- Diego Zuluaga - TSC Chair (diego@openmobilehub.com)
- Johan Othelius (johan@squidapp.co)
- Peter John Alexander (alexander@meetkai.com)
- Karthik Ayyar (karthik@bharos.in)
- Vishnu Sanal. T (t.v.s10123@gmail.com)

### TSC Meeting

A TSC meeting is required to be publicly announced (at least 10 days before the meeting) and publicly accessible. A chairperson or its deputy, who is designated by a chairperson, may announce and hold a TSC meeting.

A TSC meeting should be announced via Github or other social media such as Linkedin, or the Open Mobile Hub website (openmobilehub.com) may also be used along with the announcement.

A TSC meeting should be held at a publicly accessible place. A TSC meeting is, by default, held virtually (audio or video conference) with publicly available media that are declared with the meeting announcement.

A TSC meeting is, by default, recorded or transcribed for the general public. These records will be made publicly available within a reasonable timeframe after each meeting. The URLs or the contents of the recordings or scripts should be available via GitHub.

### Responsibilities

The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

- Coordinating the technical direction of the Project;
- Approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);
- Organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;
- Creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;
- Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;
- Establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;
- Approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with LF to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;
- Discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and
- Coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.

### Contributors

Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.

TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented:

- Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;
- Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation, or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and
- A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.

### Committers

A committer is responsible for reviewing incoming pull-requests and is able to reject or approve pull requests.

A contributor may be nominated to become a committer by any existing committer. The nomination must be approved by more than half of the existing committers.

A committer may be retired by approvals of more than half of the committers.

Alternatively, TSC may decide to elect or to retire a committer with TSC voting as well or amend the rules on how to elect/retire committers.

Each committer is also a contributor and should comply with the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), Contributing (CONTRIBUTING.md from each repo), this document (GOVERNANCE.md), and [the Linux Foundation's policies](https://lfprojects.org/policies/).

The committer(s) is/are:

- Diego Zuluaga (committer)

## Periodic Governance Review

This document shall undergo an annual review by the TSC to ensure it remains current and effective. Proposed changes must be approved by a majority vote of the TSC. The review process will consider input from the broader community, maintaining transparency and inclusivity. Updates will be communicated to all project members and made publicly available.
