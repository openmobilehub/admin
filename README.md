## Early Access Program (EAP)
The EAP is a cornerstone of our collaborative development approach, allowing community members early access to upcoming features. This direct line of feedback is invaluable for refining and enhancing our platform in alignment with user needs.

### Participate in the EAP

Get involved in shaping the future of our platform by joining the Early Access Program (EAP). Here's how to start:

1. **Learn About the EAP:** Understand the program's goals by reviewing the [EAP Overview Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KsGmMzcWv2zFbnHPClsfE_lg-8_qybn3hmhPkt5zOBM/edit#slide=id.g26b61fc7a9c_0_25).

2. **Request Feature Access:** Fill out the [EAP Feature Access Request Form](https://github.com/openmobilehub/admin/issues/new?assignees=dzuluaga%2C+prestonlau&labels=community+request&projects=&template=eap-community-request.md&title=EAP+Feature+Access+Request%3A+%5BFeature+Name%5D) to apply for early access to specific features.

3. **Provide Feedback:** Once in the program, share your insights and suggestions to help improve and refine our features.

Joining the EAP is a chance to contribute directly to the platform's development, ensuring it meets the community's needs and expectations.
